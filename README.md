## Project Overview
This project is part of the **Spring 2025 AI Studio**, a collaboration between **Break Through Tech** and the **Algorithmic Justice League (AJL)**. The goal is to build an inclusive machine learning model to classify **21 skin conditions** across diverse skin tones. The model will be evaluated using a **weighted average F1 score**, ensuring fairness and accuracy for all skin tones. This work addresses the underperformance of dermatology AI tools for darker skin tones, aiming to reduce health disparities and improve diagnostic accuracy.

## Data Exploration
### Dataset
The dataset includes images of skin conditions across diverse skin tones. Key steps in data exploration:
- **Class Distribution**: Analyzing the distribution of skin conditions to identify imbalances.
- **Skin Tone Representation**: Ensuring diverse skin tones are adequately represented.
- **Data Augmentation**: Expanding the dataset using techniques like flipping, rotation, and color adjustments.

### Key Challenges
- **Imbalanced Classes**: Some skin conditions may be underrepresented.
- **Fairness**: Ensuring the model performs equally well across all skin tones.
- **Explainability**: Making the model's decision-making process transparent.

## Approach
### 1. **Data Augmentation**
We used data augmentation techniques (e.g., flipping, rotation, color adjustments) to improve model robustness and address class imbalance.

### 2. **Transfer Learning**
We fine-tuned pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) on the competition dataset to improve accuracy and reduce computational requirements.
